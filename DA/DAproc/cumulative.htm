<P>We now can summarize the probability distribution of NPVs to evaluate
the risk associated with each alternative.&nbsp; The following cumulative
probability distribution chart shows the probability of the NPV being less
than or equal to a particular value for each alternative.&nbsp; For example,
there is a 20% chance that&nbsp; plan Beta will result in NPV that is $0
or less and there is 100% chance that plan Alpha will result in NPV of
$100 million or less.

<P>From the cumulative probability distribution chart we can conclude that
plan Alpha will be less risky because its range of possibilities is narrower
than that for plan Beta or Gamma.&nbsp; However, there is about 65% chance
that plan Beta and Gamma will realize the value that is greater than the
highest possible value with plan Alpha.&nbsp; Plan Gamma has the potential
to have the highest NPV, but at the same time it has about 27% chance of
resulting in NPV that is less than 0.

<P>Our probabilistic analysis shows that plan Beta is the best plan to
go for - it combines moderate risk with relatively high expected payoff.&nbsp;
This alternative has the highest certain equivalent ($57,405,496), thus
the initial recommendation is to go with plan Beta.
