<P>A decision diagram is a simple graphical representation of the components
of a decision problem.&nbsp; It illustrates the relationship among the
choices, uncertainties and resulting values.

<P>&nbsp;The decision to be made was defined previously: it is a choice
between three plans: Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Each plan will result in some
value for the company. In the decision diagram the decisions are represented
by rectangles and the resulting value is represented by a hexagon.

<P>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>What are the unknown quantities (uncertainties) that make this decision
difficult?

<P>The first one is rather obvious: it is hard to predict the future demand
for electronics.&nbsp; Some products become more popular than other.&nbsp;
The technology changes very rapidly and the market is highly competitive.&nbsp;
If the average demand over the next ten years is high, it will be very
important to have enough production capacity to take full advantage of
such opportunity.&nbsp; If the demand is low, the money invested in a large
plant will not be justified.&nbsp; So, the demand will affect the resulting
value of the project to VOSI.&nbsp; It is an uncertainty and is represented
by an oval in the decision diagram.&nbsp; An arrow pointing to the value
node represents relevance between the average demand and the value to the
company.

<P>Another unknown is the production cost in the future. Things are stable
now, but what happens if the labor costs go up, material costs skyrocket,
or a supplier goes out of business?&nbsp; On the other hand the technology
gets better every year and the suppliers compete on value, so there is
a good chance that the cost of materials will go down.&nbsp; All of these
factors will change the present production cost per unit.&nbsp; We don't
know the exact change of the production cost for every year.&nbsp; So,
we should include the Average Change in Production Cost (we will refer
to is as Change in Cost) uncertainty into our analysis.

<P>Even though the company knows the market price of Virtual Assistants
now, as technology improves and more competitors enter the market, the
average market price will drop.&nbsp; In order to stay competitive, VOSI
will have to adjust their average wholesale price according to the market
price. Unfortunately, just as with the production cost, the exact price
change for each year over the next ten years is not known.&nbsp; As a result
we can define the Average Change in Market Price (referred as Change in
Price) as another uncertainty.

&nbsp;The revision of the above diagram reveals that some vital information
is missing!

<P>The average demand in the future will depend on the price: the lower
the price, the higher the demand (an interesting economic phenomenon).&nbsp;
In order to represent this relevance information an arrow is drawn between
the Change in Price and the Average Demand uncertainties. This arrow says
that knowing the future price changes may provide information about future
demand.

<P>The demand will also depend on the overall market success of the product.
Since it is rather new to the market, we can only guess how popular it
will be over the next ten years. Even if the price is low, the demand will
not be very high if the product is not popular. However, if the product
is very popular, the high price may not have a significant impact on demand.

<P>If we knew both the future market success of the product and the average
change in price over the next ten years, it might be possible to predict
the average demand for the next ten years.&nbsp; For the purpose of this
demonstration we will assume that given Change in Price and Market Success,
we will know for sure what the Average Demand will be.&nbsp; In this case
the Average Demand is not an uncertainty, but a function of the other two
and it is represented by a double oval in the decision diagram.
