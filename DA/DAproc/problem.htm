<P><B>Virtual Office Solutions Inc. </B>(VOSI) is one of the world leading
suppliers of portable electronics. This includes cellular phones, laptop
computers, personal electronic organizers and other products. Recently
the R&amp;D department came up with the new personal organizer <B>Virtual
Assistant</B> that has unique and very useful features.

<P>VOSI's connected organizer, launched last year, is a hand-held computing
device designed to work with desktop and laptop computers, allowing personal
information management both remotely and on the desktop. The Virtual Assistant
can be connected to the user's Windows PC or Macintosh computer and allows
for automatic back-up and seamless synchronization of information between
the device and the larger computer, thus ensuring that both systems have
the most current information. The product allows users to carry and edit
their personal data, such as thousands of addresses, phone numbers, appointments,
and personal notes with them everywhere they go.

<P>VOSI markets hand-held electronic connected organizer products directly
to high-volume resellers, such as mass merchandisers and computer superstores.
Currently the Virtual Assistants are manufactured on the same plant that
produces the rest of VOSI's products, but with the steadily growing demand
the plant has reached its capacity. The Board of Directors decided to build
a new plant specifically for manufacturing of the Virtual Assistant. This
would free up some of the old plant's capacity for production of other
products and would enable VOSI to set up equipment specific to production
of the Virtual Assistant.

<P>The Board of Directors wants a concrete proposal on the best strategy
of such expansion.
