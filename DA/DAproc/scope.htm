<P>It is important to understand which questions are going to be addressed
in the analysis - to define the scope of the decision problem at hand.&nbsp;
Without explicit bounds it is easy to make the analysis unreasonably complicated.&nbsp;
Blindly plunging into analysis may also result in a lot of effort and money
wasted on working on the wrong problem.

<P>The analysis begins with structuring or <B>framing</B> of the decision
problem.&nbsp; The purpose of the decision frame is to specify what is
under consideration and what is not.&nbsp; All possible decisions can divided
into three categories: <I>policy</I>, <I>strategy</I> and <I>tactics</I>.&nbsp;
<B>Decision Hierarchy</B> can be very useful for illustrating these three
levels.

&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Policy level consists of questions that will be treated as given and
fixed during the analysis. In this case such questions as the need for
expansion, feasibility of continuing the production or even staying in
business are very important questions, but would make the analysis too
long and complicated.&nbsp; So, we will assume for the rest of the analysis
that these issues have been decided on.

<P>Strategy level consists of questions that the analysis will concentrate
on. The main question raised by the Board of Directors is "What expansion
plan should we go for?" The two main considerations here are the additional
capacity that the company will have and the amount of money the company
will have to spend.

<P>Tactics level consists of the decisions that will be made later, after
a specific strategy is chosen. All the operational and financial planning
will be done according to the strategy chosen and the infrastructure and
technology decisions will have to be made when the facilities are ready.
