<P>More detailed investigation of probability distributions for each uncertainty
showed that, in fact, there is a 50-50 chance of the market success being
High or Low.&nbsp; There is a 10% chance that the actual Average Change
in Price will be 8% per year, 40% chance that it will be 10% per year and
50% chance that the price change will be 14% per year.&nbsp; The decision
diagram that we have built previously can be represented as a decision
tree.&nbsp; Note that we are treating Change in Cost as known, thus it
is not represented in the decision tree.

<P>Every end point on the decision tree represents one of the possible
outcomes, or prospects.&nbsp; For example, the very first end point represents
a situation where the company had chosen Plan Alpha, then the Market Success
turned out to be high and on average the market price was 8% per year.&nbsp;
This scenario is expected to result in NPV of $94,108,906 over the next
ten years.&nbsp; This dollar amount is then converted into the utility
(u-value) using the <A HREF="preferences.htm#utility_function">utility
function</A>.

<P>The numbers below each branch for uncertainties represents the probability
of that outcome.&nbsp; For example, the probability of market Success being
"High" is 50%.&nbsp; Note that this number is the same regardless of the
plan chosen.&nbsp; This says that Market Success does not depend on the
plan choice.

<P>The expected utility of each alternative is calculated by multiplying
the u-values of all prospects of the alternative by the corresponding probabilities
and then summing them all up.&nbsp; The blue figure under each decision
branch represents the u-value of each alternative.&nbsp; Using utilities
instead of the values themselves allows to take into account the decision-maker's
rick attitude.

<P>Using the expected utility of each alternative <B>the certain equivalent</B>
of that alternative can be calculated by using the inverse of the utility
function.
<UL>The certain equivalent for an uncertain event is that certain value
(in this case expressed in dollars) which a decision maker is just willing
to accept in lieu of the gamble represented by the uncertain event. (<A HREF="references.htm">Holloway
[1979]</A>)</UL>
The best alternative is the one with the highest certain equivalent.
