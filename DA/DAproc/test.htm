<P>Since the value of information about market success is rather high,
the company may decide to look into different options for obtaining additional
information.&nbsp; The frame of the problem may be revised to incorporate
new alternatives for information gathering.&nbsp; Options may be numerous
here, but let's consider the following two.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Marketing Analysis</FONT></FONT></H3>
This analysis will be performed by a well-known consulting company.&nbsp;
The initial estimate shows that the total cost of this project will be
about $3 million.&nbsp; At the end of the analysis the consulting company
will report if they expect the market success of the Virtual Assistant
be High or Low.

<P>However, this information is not perfect.&nbsp; Historically their predictions
turned out to be true in 80% of cases.&nbsp; This means that if they say
that the success will be high, there is 80% chance that the success will
indeed be high.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Phone Survey</FONT></FONT></H3>
The company could hire a team of interns to make random phone calls to
households and businesses describing the product and asking for their opinion.&nbsp;
Based on the responses they could draw a conclusion about the future market
success of the product.

<P>The cost of such project will be about $150,000.&nbsp; Based on previous
experience with phone surveys, the company expects a 75% chance that the
survey will give the correct insight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Revised Decision Diagram</FONT></FONT></H3>
We can modify the original decision diagram to represent the new decision
and uncertainties.
<BR>&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Note that some of the arrows are omitted in order to simplify
the diagram.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Revised Decision Tree</FONT></FONT></H3>
The new decision and uncertainties have to be incorporated into the decision
tree.&nbsp; The tree becomes rather large at this point and it would not
fit very well on this page.&nbsp; The general structure of the tree is
represented by the <I>generic</I> decision tree which shows the sequence
of the nodes in the full decision tree.

&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Choosing the Test</FONT></FONT></H3>
Calculating the Certain Equivalent of each new alternative yields the following
information:

<P>Marketing Analysis -&nbsp; $82,160,996
<BR>Phone Survey -&nbsp;&nbsp; $78,586,391
<BR>No test used -&nbsp; $57,405,496

<P>Even though the Phone Survey is much cheaper and almost as accurate
as Marketing Analysis, it is much less valuable.&nbsp; That 5% of extra
accuracy is worth over $3.5 million!

<P>However, there might be a problem with both tests that we have not taken
into consideration.&nbsp; Both tests may reveal product's features and
company's strategy to a competitor.&nbsp; This may affect the market price,
demand, cost and all other uncertainties that we have identified.&nbsp;
Such impact should be further investigated in further revisions of the
model.
