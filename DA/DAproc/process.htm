<P>A decision analysis is a conversation about a decision situation that
leads the decision-maker to action. The goal of the analysis is to provide
insights into the entire decision situation, which is much more than obtaining
just a numeric answer. In fact, decision analysis often serves other purposes
besides identifying the best course of action. It may help structure information,
create new alternatives, install decision-making mechanism or procedure
and so on.

<P>The decision problems that corporations have to deal with are often
very opaque. Decision analysts apply a sequence of transparent steps to
provide insight into the problem.

<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Formulation Phase</FONT></FONT></H3>
The activity in the formulation phase addresses the question: "What is
the decision?" In order to answer this question, it is necessary to answer
the following four questions:
<UL>"Which problems will be addressed in this analysis?" - determines the
<A HREF="scope.htm">scope</A> of the analysis.
<BR>"What choices do we have?" - determines the <A HREF="alternatives.htm">alternatives</A>
that exist. Also at this stage the analysis may yield new alternatives
that have not been considered before.
<BR>"What makes the choice difficult?" - determines the <A HREF="uncertainties.htm">uncertainties</A>
that affect the outcome of the decision.
<BR>"What is the criteria that we are going to apply when making a choice?"
- determines the decision-maker's <A HREF="preferences.htm">preferences</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Evaluation Phase</FONT></FONT></H3>
The activity in the formulation phase addresses the question: "What is
the recommended alternative?" The activity in this phase can be separated
into deterministic and probabilistic analysis.
<UL>
<H4>
Deterministic Analysis</H4>
In order to estimate the value of each existing alternative it is necessary
to construct a <A HREF="model.htm">Business Value Model</A>. This model
estimates the financial value for each possible outcome of the decision
situation.
<BR><A HREF="deterministic.htm">Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis</A>
identifies the uncertain factors that have the largest effect on the uncertainty
in the value of each alternative.&nbsp; It is also called SenSitivity to
Ranges.
<H4>
Probabilistic Analysis</H4>
The analyst can determine the <A HREF="cumulative.htm">Probability Distribution</A>
of value to illustrate the risk associated with each alternatives.&nbsp;
The best alternative is the one that has the highest expected utility.&nbsp;
The expected utility measure takes into account not only the expected value
of the alternative, but also the decision-maker's risk and time preferences.
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Appraisal Phase</FONT></FONT></H3>
The activities in this phase answer the question: "Why should the recommended
alternative be implemented?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Here more <A HREF="sensitivity.htm">sensitivity
analysis</A> is performed to evaluate the robustness of the recommendation.&nbsp;
The decision analyst may calculate the <A HREF="vopi.htm">Value of Information</A>
for critical uncertainties.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Interaction Between Decision-Makers
and Decision Analyst</FONT></FONT></H3>
In the beginning of the dialog, the analyst has to learn about client's
business and the problem at hand. The decision-maker plays the role of
a teacher, communicating the details of the problem and relevant technical
and operational information to the analyst.&nbsp; As the analysis progresses,
the analyst focuses on most important aspects of the problem and gains
insight into the problem and client's business.&nbsp; In the second part
of the dialog, the roles shift: the analyst plays the role of teacher,
presenting the recommended action, and pointing out the important insights
into the client's business.

<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>More on the Decision Analysis Process</FONT></FONT></H3>
Some analysts view the Decision Analysis Process as consisting of two cycles:
Deterministic and Probabilistic.

<P>First, the problem is formulated and solved as deterministic.&nbsp;
This can be achieved by setting unknown variables to some feasible values.&nbsp;
Such analysis points out the variables that "drive the decision" - influence
the resulting value the most.&nbsp; Sometimes the Deterministic Analysis
will point out the course of action that is the best regardless of the
uncertainty.&nbsp; In this case it is said that the alternative "deterministically
dominates" other alternatives.

<P>Then the problem is re-formulated taking into consideration the results
of the Deterministic Analysis.&nbsp; As a result, some variables will be
treated as known and others will be examined more closely.&nbsp; This information
is incorporated into the Value Model and evaluated.&nbsp; The evaluation
of this model yields the probabilistic distribution of the expected utility.

&nbsp;

<P>More experienced decision analysts may not have a strict structure to
their decision process.&nbsp; They will use various tools according to
the specific problem and situation.
