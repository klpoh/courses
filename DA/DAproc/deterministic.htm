<P>Now we can evaluate how each of the uncertainties affect the resulting
NPV of the whole project.

<P>Tornado diagrams offer an effective tool for representing results of
the deterministic sensitivity analysis. First, the all the variables in
the value model are set to the "Base" value. The resulting NPV is the "Base
Case" value for the alternative.&nbsp; Then, for each of the variables
in turn, the model is evaluated at the low value of the variable and then
at the high value of the variable (with all other parameters kept at their
base value). The difference between the low and high value of the model
is a measure of how sensitive the problem is to change in that variable.

The company will enjoy a moderate NPV of this plan without much variance.
The NPV is not affected very much by the uncertainties.&nbsp; Market Success
has the highest impact on the value in this case.&nbsp; Note that when
the Average Change in Price is at its high value, the NPV is small and
vice versa.&nbsp; In this case the drop in price reduces the revenue but
does not stimulate enough demand to compensate this loss.

This alternative offers a higher Base Case NPV than Plan Alpha but it is
clearly more risky: the NPV almost drops to zero when the Market Success
is low. The larger swing of the bars on the diagram shows that the NPV
will be significantly affected by the variables. However, Market Success
and Change in Price would have the most impact on the resulting value.

Even though the Base Case Value for this alternative is rather high, there
can be a great risk involved in pursuing it. When the Market Success is
"Low", it drops to a negative value.

<P>An interesting thing happens here: for both low and high values of Change
in Price variable, the NPV of the alternative is smaller than for the base-case
Change in Price.&nbsp; It can be explained easily: if the price drops by
a large amount per year the company will enjoy higher demand, but lose
on the revenues. When the price does not drop by much, the demand will
not be there. The base-case value balances the two effects: the price is
high enough to bring in sufficient revenue and is low enough to attract
customers.

<FONT COLOR="#6C18B0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Conclusions</FONT></FONT></H3>
There is no deterministic dominance among the alternatives - none of the
alternatives is clearly better or worse than others. Therefore it is necessary
to continue on with the probabilistic analysis.

<P>The tornado diagrams show that the Change in Cost uncertainty does not
seriously affect the NPV. This means that in further analysis it is possible
to set its value to the "Base" value and consider it as constant. However,
Market Success and Change in Price have to be investigated further in the
probabilistic analysis.
