      <b>Improbable Inspiration</b><p>
      The future of software may lie in the obscure theories of an
      18th century cleric named Thomas Bayes.

      When Microsoft Senior Vice President Steve
      Ballmer first heard his company was planning to make a huge
      investment in an Internet service offering movie reviews and
      local entertainment information in major cities across the
      nation, he went to Chairman Bill Gates with his concerns.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Ballmer has billions of dollars of
      his own money in Microsoft stock, and entertainment isn't
      exactly the company's strong point.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Gates dismissed such
      reservations. Microsoft's competitive advantage, he responded,
      was its expertise in &quot;Bayesian networks.&quot;

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked recently when computers would finally
      begin to understand human speech, Gates began discussing the
      critical role of &quot;Bayesian&quot; systems.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask any other software executive about
      anything &quot;Bayesian&quot; and you're liable to get a blank
      stare.

      <p> 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Gates onto something? Is this
      alien-sounding technology Microsoft's new secret weapon?

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite possibly.
      
      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks are complex diagrams that
      organize the body of knowledge in any given area by mapping out
      cause-and-effect relationships among key variables and encoding
      them with numbers that represent the extent to which one
      variable is likely to affect another.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programmed into computers, these systems can
      automatically generate optimal predictions or decisions even
      when key pieces of information are missing.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Microsoft in 1993 hired Eric Horvitz,
      David Heckerman and Jack Breese, pioneers in the development of
      Bayesian systems, colleagues in the field were surprised. The
      field was still an obscure, largely academic enterprise.

      <p>
 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today the field is still obscure. But scratch
      the surface of a range of new Microsoft products and you're
      likely to find Bayesian networks embedded in the software. And
      Bayesian nets are being built into models that are used to
      predict oil and stock prices, control the space shuttle and
      diagnose disease.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artificial intelligence (AI) experts, who saw
      their field discredited in the early 1980s after promising a
      wave of &quot;thinking&quot; computers that they ultimately
      couldn't produce, believe widening acceptance of the Bayesian
      approach could herald a renaissance in the field.

      <p>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks provide &quot;an
      overarching graphical framework&quot; that brings together
      diverse elements of AI and increases the range of its likely
      application to the real world, says Michael Jordon, professor of
      brain and cognitive science at the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is unquestionably the most
      aggressive in exploiting the new approach. The company offers a
      free Web service that helps customers diagnose printing problems
      with their computers and recommends the quickest way to resolve
      them. Another Web service helps parents diagnose their
      children's health problems.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest version of Microsoft Office
      software uses the technology to offer a user help based on past
      experience, how the mouse is being moved and what task is being
      done.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If his actions show he is distracted,
      he is likely to need help,&quot; Horvitz says. &quot;If he's
      been working on a chart, chances are he needs help formatting
      the chart.&quot;

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Gates likes to talk about how computers
      are now deaf, dumb, blind and clueless. The Bayesian stuff helps
      deal with the clueless part,&quot; says Daniel T.  Ling,
      director of Microsoft's research division and a former IBM
      scientist.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks get their name from the
      Rev. Thomas Bayes, who wrote an essay, posthumously published in
      1763, that offered a mathematical formula for calculating
      probabilities among several variables that are causally related
      but for which--unlike calculating the probability of a coin
      landing on heads or tails--the relationships can't easily be
      derived by experimentation.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early students of probability applied the
      ideas to discussions about the existence of God or efforts to
      improve their odds in gambling. Much later, social scientists
      used it to help clarify the key factors influencing a particular
      event.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was the rapid progress in computer
      power and the development of key mathematical equations that
      made it possible for the first time, in the late 1980s, to
      compute Bayesian networks with enough variables that they were
      useful in practical applications.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bayesian approach filled a void in the
      decades-long effort to add intelligence to computers.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 1970s and '80s, reacting to the
      &quot;brute force&quot; approach to problem solving by early
      users of computers, proponents of the emerging field of
      artificial intelligence began developing software programs using
      rule-based, if-then propositions. But the systems took time to
      put together and didn't work well if, as was frequently the
      case, you couldn't answer all the computer's questions clearly.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later companies began using a technique
      called &quot;neural nets&quot; in which a computer would be
      presented with huge amounts of data on a particular problem and
      programmed to pull out patterns. A computer fed with a big stack
      of X-rays and told whether or not cancer was present in each
      case would pick out patterns that would then be used to
      interpret X-rays.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the neural nets won't help predict the
      unforeseen. You can't train a neural net to identify an incoming
      missile or plane because you could never get sufficient data to
      train the system.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In part because of these limitations, a slew
      of companies that popped up in the early 1980s to sell
      artificial intelligence systems virtually all went bankrupt.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many AI techniques continued to be
      used. Credit card companies, for example, began routinely using
      neural networks to pick out transactions that don't look right
      based on a consumer's past behavior. But increasingly, AI was
      regarded as a tool with limited use.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the late 1980s--spurred by the early
      work of Judea Pearl, a professor of computer science at UCLA,
      and breakthrough mathematical equations by <a
      href="http://www.hugin.dk">Danish researchers</a>--AI
      researchers discovered that Bayesian networks offered an
      efficient way to deal with the lack or ambiguity of information
      that has hampered previous systems.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horvitz and his two Microsoft colleagues, who
      were then classmates at Stanford University, began building
      Bayesian networks to help diagnose the condition of patients
      without turning to surgery.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach was efficient, says Horvitz,
      because you could combine historical data, which had been
      meticulously gathered, with the less precise but more intuitive
      knowledge of experts on how things work to get the optimal
      answer given the information available at a given time.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horvitz, who with two colleagues founded
      Knowledge Industries to develop tools for developing Bayesian
      networks, says he and the others left the company to join
      Microsoft in part because they wanted to see their theoretical
      work more broadly applied.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the company did important work for
      the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and on medical
      diagnostics, Horvitz says, &quot;It's not like your grandmother
      will use it.&quot;

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft's activities in the field are now
      helping to build a groundswell of support for Bayesian ideas.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;People look up to Microsoft,&quot; says
      Pearl, who wrote one of the key early texts on Bayesian networks
      in 1988 and has become an unofficial spokesman for the
      field. &quot;They've given a boost to the whole area.&quot;
                     
      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A researcher at German conglomerate Siemens
      says Microsoft's work has drawn the attention of his superiors,
      who are now looking seriously at applying Bayesian concepts to a
      range of industrial applications.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott Musman, a computer consultant in
      Arlington, Va., recently designed a Bayesian network for the
      Navy that can identify enemy missiles, aircraft or vessels and
      recommend which weapons could be used most advantageously
      against incoming targets.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Musman says previous attempts using
      traditional mathematical approaches on state-of-the-art
      computers would get the right answer but would take two to three
      minutes.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But you only have 30 seconds before the
      missile has hit you,&quot; says Musman.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Electric is using Bayesian techniques
      to develop a system that will take information from sensors
      attached to an engine and, based on expert opinion built into
      the system as well as vast amounts of data on past engine
      performance, pinpoint emerging problems.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is working on techniques that will
      enable the Bayesian networks to &quot;learn&quot; or update
      themselves automatically based on new knowledge, a task that is
      currently cumbersome.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The company is also working on using Bayesian
      techniques to improve upon popular AI approaches such as
      &quot;data mining&quot; and &quot;collaborative filtering&quot;
      that help draw out relevant pieces of information from massive
      databases. The latter will be used by Microsoft in its new
      online entertainment service to help people identify the kind of
      restaurants or entertainment they are most likely to enjoy.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, as effective as they are proving to be
      in early use, Bayesian networks face an uphill battle in gaining
      broad acceptance.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;An effective solution came just as the
      bloom had come off the AI rose,&quot; says Peter Hart, head of
      Ricoh's California Research Center at Menlo Park, a pioneer of
      AI.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And skeptics insist any computer reasoning
      system will always fall short of people's expectations because
      of the computer's tendency to miss what is often obvious to the
      human expert.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, Hart believes the technology will
      catch on because it is cost-effective.  Hart developed a
      Bayesian-based system that enabled Ricoh's copier help desk to
      answer twice the number of customer questions in almost half the
      time.

      <p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hart says Ricoh is now looking at embedding
      the networks in products so customers can see for themselves
      what the likely problems are. He believes auto makers will soon
      build Bayesian nets into cars that predict when various
      components of a car need to be repaired or replaced.
